Akkado has two kinds of audio signals: **Mono** (one channel) and **Stereo** (two channels, L and R). Channel count isn't a runtime property — it's a type the compiler tracks through every expression, so mismatches surface at compile time. Every audio effect is also stereo-native: it processes both channels in one pass, and a mono input automatically widens to stereo. You never duplicate a chain by hand.

## Defaults

Generators (`osc`, `noise`, `pulse`) are **mono** by default; effects are stereo-native and preserve their input's channel count. To start a chain in stereo, widen at the boundary:

```akkado
// Mono — single channel
saw(220)

// Stereo — duplicate mono across both channels
saw(220) |> stereo(@)

// Stereo — distinct L and R
stereo(saw(218), saw(222))
```

`out()` accepts either:

```akkado
saw(220) |> out(@)          // Mono → duplicated to L and R
stereo(saw(218), saw(222))
    |> out(@)               // Stereo → split into L and R
out(saw(218), saw(222))     // Two mono signals → L, R explicitly
```

## Conversions

There are exactly two canonical conversions between the representations:

| Call | Direction | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `stereo(x)` | Mono → Stereo | Duplicate `x` to both L and R |
| `stereo(l, r)` | two Mono → Stereo | Pair `l` as L, `r` as R |
| `mono(s)` | Stereo → Mono | Sum-to-mono with 0.5 gain: `(L + R) * 0.5` |
| `left(s)` | Stereo → Mono | Extract the left channel only |
| `right(s)` | Stereo → Mono | Extract the right channel only |

Calling a conversion on a signal that's already the target channel count is a **warning**, not an error — it almost always means something upstream didn't do what you thought, but the expression still compiles and evaluates to the input unchanged. Some typical hits:

- `stereo(already_stereo_signal)` → `W182`
- `mono(already_mono_signal)` → `W181`
- `left(mono_signal)` / `right(mono_signal)` → `W183` / `W184`
- `out(stereo_signal, other)` as *two-arg* `out()` → `W185` (auto-escalates)

A genuine *type* mismatch — an audio-rate signal in a non-signal slot, for example — is still a hard error (`E186`).

### Panning a stereo signal

`pan()` has two signatures dispatched by the channel type of its first argument:

```akkado
// Mono → Stereo: equal-power mono pan
mono_sig |> pan(@, 0.3)

// Stereo → Stereo: equal-power stereo balance
stereo_sig |> pan(@, 0.3)
```

The stereo overload is DAW-style balance — `L_out = L * cos θ`, `R_out = R * sin θ` with `θ = (p + 1) · π/4`. At `p = 0` both channels drop by ~3 dB (equal-power centre); at `p = ±1` one channel is silenced. See the [Stereo builtins reference](/docs/reference/builtins/stereo) for the math.

## Stereo-native effects

Every audio effect is **stereo-native**: it processes both channels in a single dispatch with one per-channel state struct. A **mono** input automatically widens — the opcode reads it once and uses it for both the L and R lanes — so you never have to duplicate a chain or insert `stereo()` to get a stereo result.

```akkado
bus = saw(220)           // Mono — widens automatically

bus
    |> lp(@, 500, 0.7)   // Stereo: per-channel filter state
    |> delay(@, 0.25, 0.5)      // Stereo: per-channel delay line
    |> out(@)                   // Stereo out
```

For channel-independent effects (filters, distortion, EQ, plain delays) this is exactly equivalent to writing:

```akkado
sig = saw(220)

left_out = sig
    |> lp(@, 500, 0.7)
    |> delay(@, 0.25, 0.5)

right_out = sig
    |> lp(@, 500, 0.7)
    |> delay(@, 0.25, 0.5)

out(left_out, right_out)
```

Identical state handling, identical audio. Stateless effects (`saturate`, `softclip`, `fold`, `distort`) work the same way. Spatializing effects (reverbs, `chorus`, `phaser`, `flanger`) go further: a mono input widens into a genuinely *decorrelated* stereo output (cross-coupled reverb tanks, offset L/R LFO phases). A *stereo* input into a spatializing effect runs through a single cross-coupled instance — `dattorro`, `freeverb`, `fdn` each get one set of tanks with L↔R cross-bleed, not two independent mono reverbs in parallel.

### Tuning stereo width on modulation FX

`chorus`, `flanger`, and `phaser` expose an extended parameter `lfo_phase` — the offset between the L and R LFOs, in **turns** (0.0–1.0). Default is `0.25` (= 90°), the classic stereo-modulation setting.

```akkado
// Default: 90° offset, classic stereo chorus
saw(220)
    |> chorus(@, 0.5, 0.4)
    |> out(@)

// 0 = mono-equivalent (L = R); 0.5 = anti-phase
// (max width, may collapse on mono-summing)
saw(220)
    |> chorus(@, 0.5, 0.4, lfo_phase: 0.5)
    |> out(@)

saw(110)
    |> phaser(@, 0.3, 0.8, lfo_phase: 0)
    |> out(@)
```

`phaser` also exposes `feedback` and `stages` the same way. Named-argument syntax (`name: value`) skips intervening defaults — pass only what you want to change.

### What stereo-native processing doesn't change

- **Scalar parameters (cutoff, resonance, time, feedback) are shared between L and R.** Both channels see the same value. If you want independent per-channel modulation, split the stream explicitly.
- **Pattern events (`pat`, `seq`, `timeline`) are always mono** — a stereo synth driven by a mono pattern is the normal case.
- **Generators stay mono.** `osc`, `noise`, `pulse` return Mono; the widening happens at the boundary into the first effect.
- **`sample()` is the exception — always Stereo.** A mono file broadcasts to L=R; a stereo file preserves its L/R channels; files with 3+ channels keep the first two and drop the rest. Either way the output type is Stereo, so downstream effects skip the auto-widening step.
- **Cross-channel effects** like `width`, `pingpong`, `ms_encode`/`ms_decode` have their own explicit stereo signatures.

## Mixed-channel arithmetic

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/` on a **mono** and a **stereo** operand broadcast the mono side across both channels:

```akkado
dry = saw(220)               // Mono

// Stereo — freeverb auto-widens
wet = dry |> freeverb(@, 0.9, 0.5)

// Stereo out (mono dry broadcast onto wet)
dry * 0.3 + wet * 0.7 |> out(@)
```

The `dry * 0.3` stays mono, `wet * 0.7` stays stereo, and `mono + stereo` promotes to stereo by dual-reading the mono buffer. No extra instructions.

Mono on mono stays mono. Stereo on stereo stays stereo (L op L, R op R). There's no implicit mono-to-stereo promotion anywhere else — the compiler will complain if it can't make sense of a mismatch.

## Patterns and Signals

Patterns (`n"…"`, `v"…"`, `c"…"`, `s"…"`) carry a primary value buffer that doubles as a Signal. When you pass a pattern to a slot that expects a Signal — `sine(n"c4 e4 g4")`, `lp(sig, v"<200 800>", 0.7)` — the compiler implicitly extracts that buffer.

The **Pattern → Signal coerce** rule:

| Pattern shape           | Coerces to Signal? | Where the buffer points                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Monophonic note (`n"…"`)| Yes                | `freq` field — Hz post-mtof              |
| Numeric (`v"…"`)        | Yes                | `freq` field — raw scalar                |
| Sample (`s"…"`)         | Yes                | Audio output (post-`SAMPLE_PLAY`)        |
| Polyphonic chord (`c"…"`) | **No — E160**    | Use `poly()` to expand voices            |
| Polyphonic note (e.g. `n"[c4,e4]"`) | **No — E160** | Use `poly()`                       |

### Operator type rules

Arithmetic between patterns and other types follows these rules:

| LHS     | RHS     | Result   | Notes                                        |
|---------|---------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Pattern | Pattern | Pattern  | Pointwise op on `freq` buffers, longest wins |
| Pattern | Signal  | Signal   | Pattern coerces; sample-rate result          |
| Pattern | Number  | Pattern  | `n"c4 e4" + 12` is still a Pattern           |
| Signal  | Signal  | Signal   | Standard                                     |
| Pattern | Stereo  | E165     | Wrap with `stereo(scalar(...))` explicitly   |

### `scalar()` — the explicit cast

`scalar(p)` unwraps a monophonic pattern's `freq` buffer. It's idempotent on Signals (`scalar(scalar(p))` is safe) and errors **E161** on sample / polyphonic patterns. See the [Pattern Literals reference](/docs/reference/pattern/literals).
