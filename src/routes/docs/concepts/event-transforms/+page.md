A pattern modifier in Akkado is a function that takes an **event stream** — a `Pattern` or a MIDI `EventSource` — and returns a new one with per-event fields rewritten. They compose with the pipe operator and chain freely.

```akkado
n"c4 e4 g4".transpose(7).velocity(0.4) |> sine(@.freq) * @.vel |> out(@)
```

Under the hood every per-field modifier is a **one-line stdlib `fn`** sitting on top of two primitive builtins: `event_map` and `event_filter`. The mapping is direct — `transpose(p, n)` *is* `event_map(p, (e) -> {note: e.note + n})`. You can read the actual definitions in [`akkado/stdlib/event_transforms.ak`](https://github.com/) (one file, ~15 lines).

This means you can write your own modifier and have it work everywhere a builtin does — patterns, chord patterns, MIDI streams, chained transforms — with no compiler change.

## The two primitives

### `event_map(events, closure)`

Rewrite every event's fields with a closure.

```akkado
n"c4 e4 g4".event_map((e) -> {note: e.note + 12, vel: e.vel * 0.5})
```

The closure receives an **event record** with these readable fields: `freq`, `vel`, `dur`, `note`, `chance`, `time`, `gate`, `trig`. It returns a record literal naming the fields to **overlay** — unspecified fields pass through unchanged.

The writable fields are `note`, `vel`, `dur`, `time`, `chance`, `bend`, `at`. Writing `note` rewrites the primary `midi_note` *and* every chord voice's `notes[]` and `values[]` — `transpose(7)` shifts an entire chord stack, not just the root.

Closure bodies are pure: stateful opcodes (oscillators, filters, state cells, `out()`) are not allowed inside. Arithmetic, math builtins, and references to outer signals (the LFO buffer is sampled at each event's onset) are fine.

### `event_filter(events, predicate)`

Drop events whose closure returns `≤ 0`.

```akkado
n"c4 d4 e4 f4 g4".event_filter((e) -> e.vel - 0.3)  // keep only events with vel > 0.3
```

## Writing your own modifier

Any `fn` annotated with `events: evs` accepts a Pattern or EventSource and can plug into a pipe chain via UFCS.

```akkado
fn arp_up(events: evs, steps) -> {
    event_map(events, (e) -> {note: e.note + (cycle_count() mod steps) * 12})
}

n"c4 g4".arp_up(3) |> saw(@.freq) |> out(@)
```

The `events: evs` annotation is part of [parameter type annotations](parameter-type-annotations). Without it, a user `fn` parameter that receives a polyphonic Pattern would error with `E160`; the annotation tells the analyzer this fn is an event-stream consumer.

## What ships in stdlib

| Modifier | Field written | Math |
|---|---|---|
| `transpose(events, n)` | `note` (coupled across chord voices) | `+ n` |
| `velocity(events, v)` | `vel` | `* v` |
| `dur(events, d)` | `dur` | `* d` |
| `bend(events, b)` | `bend` | `= b` |
| `aftertouch(events, a)` | `at` | `= a` |
| `early(events, t)` | `time` | `(time − t) mod 1.0` |
| `late(events, t)` | `time` | `(time + t) mod 1.0` |
| `swing(events, grid=8)` | `time` | 1/3-amount swing on `grid`-slice grid |
| `swingBy(events, amount, grid=8)` | `time` | `amount` swing on `grid`-slice grid |

Structural transforms (`rev`, `palindrome`, `ply`, `linger`, `zoom`, `segment`, `compress`, `iter`, `iterBack`) are C++ builtins that lower to two runtime opcodes — `EVENT_REORDER` (rev / palindrome / iter / iter_back / zoom / compress) and `EVENT_FANOUT` (ply / linger / segment). Each reads upstream `OutputEvents` and publishes its own, so structural transforms compose freely with `event_map` / `event_filter` / `fast` / `slow` chains. See "Structural transforms" below.

## Rate scaling — `fast` / `slow`

`fast(p, x)` and `slow(p, x)` time-warp a pattern. Phase 3 makes them runtime: the factor may now be a constant **or a signal**.

```akkado
n"c d e f".fast(2)                              // constant — 2x speed
n"c d e f".fast(sine(0.1) * 1.5 + 2)      // signal — speed wobbles with LFO
n"c d e f".slow(sine(0.2) + 2)            // signal slow — wobble-stretched
```

**How it works.** Each `fast`/`slow` call recompiles its inner pattern into its own `SequenceState` (so two transforms applied to the same pattern stay independent) and emits an `EVENT_RATE_SCALE` opcode. Each block the opcode writes `cycle_length = original / rate` into the upstream `SequenceState`; every `SEQPAT_*` opcode reads `cycle_length` when scaling event times, so a single-field write covers the entire downstream pipeline.

**Composition.** `fast(slow(p, 2), 3)` chains naturally: the inner `slow(2)` is applied via the legacy compile-time path (`cycle_length` → 2), then the outer `fast(3)`'s `EVENT_RATE_SCALE` adjusts at runtime (cycle_length → 2/3 ≈ 0.667 — net 1.5× speed).

**Limits in Phase 3.**

- The rate is sampled at block boundaries — events still snap to the 128-sample block grid when the factor is a signal. Sub-block sample accuracy is a follow-up.
- Nested signal-rate scaling (`fast(slow(p, lfo), other_lfo)`) is not supported: the inner signal-rate slow would need its own `EVENT_RATE_SCALE`, but the outer fast's compile-time path can't see through a runtime factor. Use a single signal-rate fast/slow per chain.
- `fast(p, 0)` or `fast(p, -1)` is rejected at compile time with `E185`. A signal that dips below zero is clamped to `0.001` at runtime to keep playback monotonic.
- `fast`/`slow` on a live MIDI stream is currently rejected with the same `E133` as other non-pattern arguments; a no-op pass-through with a warning is a planned follow-up.

## Shadowing built-in modifiers

User `fn`s shadow stdlib ones. To redefine `transpose` with a different convention (say, scale degrees instead of semitones), just write it:

```akkado
scale = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]  // major scale steps

fn transpose(events: evs, deg) -> {
    event_map(events, (e) -> {note: e.note + scale[deg]})
}

n"c4 e4 g4".transpose(2) |> sine(@.freq) |> out(@)
```

This overrides the stdlib definition for the rest of the file.

## Time-shift wraparound

`early` and `late` operate on cycle phase `[0, 1)`. The event-time field wraps via `fmod` and re-sorts at the runtime opcode boundary, so events that move past the cycle edge land in the right block position automatically:

```akkado
n"c4 e4 g4 b4".late(0.25)  // shifts every event +0.25 cycles; the b4 wraps to time 0
```

For cross-cycle reasoning, `e.cycle` exposes the absolute cycle count.

## Structural transforms

The structural family rewrites *event timing and count*, not just per-field values. Each lowers to one of two runtime opcodes that read upstream `OutputEvents` and publish their own.

```akkado
n"c4 e4 g4 a4".rev()                       // EVENT_REORDER(REV) — time-reverse
n"[c4 e4]".palindrome()                    // EVENT_REORDER(PALINDROME) — forward + backward, 2× cycle
n"c4 e4 g4 a4".iter(4)                     // EVENT_REORDER(ITER) — rotate by 1/n per cycle
n"c4 e4 g4 a4".iterBack(4)                 // ITER with reversed direction
n"c4 e4 g4 a4".zoom(0.25, 0.75)            // EVENT_REORDER(ZOOM) — window + rescale
n"c4 e4 g4 a4".compress(0.0, 0.5)          // EVENT_REORDER(COMPRESS) — squash into [s, e)
n"[c4 e4]".ply(3)                          // EVENT_FANOUT(PLY) — each event → N sub-events
n"c4 e4 g4 a4".linger(0.5)                 // EVENT_FANOUT(LINGER) — keep first frac, loop
n"c4 e4".segment(8)                        // EVENT_FANOUT(SEGMENT) — N grid-point samples
```

| Transform | Opcode | Output cardinality | Continuous param? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rev(p)` | EVENT_REORDER(REV) | same | n/a |
| `palindrome(p)` | EVENT_REORDER(PALINDROME) | ×2 | n/a |
| `iter(p, n)` / `iterBack(p, n)` | EVENT_REORDER(ITER) | same | `n` is const int in `[1, 255]` |
| `zoom(p, s, e)` | EVENT_REORDER(ZOOM) | ≤ same | `s` / `e` may be signals |
| `compress(p, s, e)` | EVENT_REORDER(COMPRESS) | same | `s` / `e` may be signals |
| `ply(p, n)` | EVENT_FANOUT(PLY) | ×n | `n` is const int |
| `linger(p, frac)` | EVENT_FANOUT(LINGER) | ≤ same; cycle_length × frac | `frac` may be a signal |
| `segment(p, n)` | EVENT_FANOUT(SEGMENT) | n | `n` is const int |

**Composition works at runtime.** Because every structural transform reads upstream `OutputEvents` via the same `resolve_output_events` boundary as `event_map` / `event_filter`, any chain composes:

```akkado
n"[c4 e4]".transpose(5).palindrome()           // EVENT_MAP feeds EVENT_REORDER
n"[c4 e4]".rev().velocity(0.5)                 // EVENT_REORDER feeds EVENT_MAP
n"[c4 e4]".fast(2).bend(0.3).rev()             // ERS → EVENT_MAP → EVENT_REORDER
ply(rev(n"[c4 e4]"), 3)                        // FANOUT on top of REORDER
```

**Compile-time fold for nested constants.** Mirroring Phase 3 fast/slow, `compile_pattern_for_transform` still applies any inner structural transform at compile time when nested inside another transform. So `rev(fast(p, 2))` collapses the inner fast into the inner `SequenceProgram`'s `cycle_length` and emits only the outer `EVENT_REORDER`. Mixed chains where the inner is a runtime `event_map` (e.g., `rev(bend(p, 0.3))`) go through the full runtime path; no behavior is lost.

**iter cycle counter.** `iter(p, n)` / `iterBack(p, n)` derive the current cycle index from `ctx.global_sample_counter / (samples_per_cycle × upstream_cycle_length)` and rotate by `-dir × (cycle_index mod n) / n` of the cycle. This replaces the legacy `iter_n` / `iter_dir` fields on `SequenceState`, which were deleted in Phase 4 Commit C alongside the SEQPAT_QUERY rotation block.

## Composing with MIDI

Because both Patterns and MIDI EventSources share the `OutputEvents` wire format, the same transforms apply uniformly:

```akkado
midi("ctrl1").transpose(12).velocity(0.7) |> poly(@, instr, 8)
```
