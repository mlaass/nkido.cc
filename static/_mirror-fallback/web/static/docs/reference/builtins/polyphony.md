# Polyphony

Voice allocation for patterns. `poly()` runs an instrument function per voice and sums the outputs. `mono()` and `legato()` are single-voice variants with different retrigger behavior. `spread()` distributes an array across N voices for unison stacks.

## poly

**Polyphonic Voice Manager** - Allocates voices for a pattern and runs an instrument function per voice.

| Param      | Type     | Default | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| input      | pattern  | -       | Pattern or `chord(...)` producing events (notes or chords) |
| instrument | function | -       | A function `(freq, gate, vel) -> signal` run per voice |
| voices     | number   | 64      | Voice count (1-128, must be a literal) |

`poly()` reads pattern events at runtime and assigns each note to its own voice slot. The instrument function receives per-voice frequency, gate, and velocity, and the outputs of all active voices are summed. When the same note appears in consecutive events, the voice slot is reused (preserving phase continuity); when all voices are busy, the oldest is stolen.

The instrument must be a 3-parameter function; the names don't matter but the order is fixed: `(freq, gate, vel)`.

```akk
// Polyphonic chord progression with the default 64 voices
stab = (freq, gate, vel) ->
    saw(freq) * ar(gate, 0.05, 0.4) * vel
    |> lp(@, 1100)

chord("C Em Am G") |> poly(@, stab) |> out(@)
```

```akk
// Lower voice count if you want predictable stealing
pat("c4 e4 g4 b4") |> poly(@, (f, g, v) -> osc("sin", f) * v, 8) |> out(@)
```

## mono

**Monophonic Voice Manager** - Single-voice manager with retrigger on every new note.

| Param      | Type     | Default | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| input      | pattern  | -       | Pattern producing events |
| instrument | function | -       | A function `(freq, gate, vel) -> signal` |

`mono()` is `poly()` with one voice and last-note priority. Every new note retriggers the gate, so envelopes restart cleanly: the classic hardware-mono behavior.

`mono(stereo_signal)` is a different builtin (stereo-to-mono downmix). The compiler routes based on argument type: a function instrument gets the voice manager; a stereo signal gets the downmix.

```akk
// Mono lead with retrigger on every note
pat("c4 e4 g4 c5") |> mono((f, g, v) -> saw(f) * adsr(g, 0.01, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3)) |> out(@)
```

## legato

**Legato Voice Manager** - Single-voice with no retrigger between connected notes.

| Param      | Type     | Default | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| input      | pattern  | -       | Pattern producing events |
| instrument | function | -       | A function `(freq, gate, vel) -> signal` |

Like `mono()`, but the gate stays high while notes overlap, so envelopes don't restart on every note. Frequency and velocity update but the AR/ADSR keeps decaying through the phrase. Best for legato leads and bass lines.

```akk
// Smooth bassline, gate stays high across notes
pat("c2 e2 g2 c3") |> legato((f, g, v) -> saw(f) * adsr(g, 0.01, 0.2, 0.8, 0.4)) |> out(@)
```

## spread

**Spread** - Distribute an array across N voices evenly.

| Param  | Type   | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| n      | number | -       | Number of voices to spread across |
| source | array  | -       | Source array of values |

`spread()` is a compile-time helper that takes an array and distributes its values across `n` slots, repeating or reducing as needed. Useful for unison voices and detuned stacks.

```akk
// Detuned saw stack, 5 oscillators across the array
osc("saw", spread(5, [220, 220.7, 219.3, 221.4, 218.6])) |> out(@)
```

## voice

A **voice** is one independent instance of the instrument function. `poly()` runs N voices in parallel; `mono()` and `legato()` use one. Voice slots are pre-allocated at compile time; runtime allocation is just a slot lookup.

## voices

The **voice count** parameter to `poly()` (default 64). Must be a literal — the compiler needs to know it for static allocation. Lower voice counts give predictable voice stealing; higher counts handle complex patterns without dropouts.
