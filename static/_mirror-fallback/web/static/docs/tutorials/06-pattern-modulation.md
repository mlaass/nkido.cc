# Pattern Modulation

So far patterns have driven note pitches. They can also be used as **values**: feeding any DSP slot from a pattern, modulating per-event properties, and combining via arithmetic.

## Patterns are values

A pattern is a stream of events stepping through values over time. When you write:

```akk
osc("sin", n"c4 e4 g4")
```

the compiler takes the pattern's frequency buffer and feeds it to `osc`'s freq slot. Patterns coerce to scalar Signals automatically.

## Numeric patterns with v"…"

Sometimes you want raw numbers, not mtof'd notes. Use `v"…"`:

```akk
// Three frequencies, no mtof, just the literal Hz values
osc("sin", v"<220 440 880>") |> out(%, %)

// Filter cutoff sweeping through three values per cycle
sig = osc("saw", 440)
lp(sig, v"<200 800 2000>", 0.7) |> out(%, %)

// Amplitude scrubber
osc("saw", 220) * v"<0.2 0.5 1.0 0.5>" |> out(%, %)
```

Atoms in `v"…"` must be numeric; `v"c4"` is a parse error.

## Per-event modulation

Pattern-valued bend depth: each note bends by the corresponding pattern value.

```akk
n"c4 e4 g4" |> bend(%, v"<0 0.5 -0.5>") as e
  |> osc("sin", e.freq + e.bend * 12)
  |> out(%, %)
```

The same shape works for `aftertouch()` and `dur()`:

```akk
n"c4 e4 g4 b4" |> aftertouch(%, v"<0 0.25 0.5 1.0>")  // crescendo
n"c4 e4 g4"    |> dur(%, v"<0.25 0.5 1.0>")           // pattern-driven note length
```

Constant args still work; `bend(notes, 0.5)` is unchanged.

## Custom-property accessor

A note can carry arbitrary record-suffix keys; the binding `as e` exposes each as a Signal:

```akk
n"c4{cutoff:0.3} e4{cutoff:0.7} g4{cutoff:0.5}" as e
  |> osc("saw", e.freq)
  |> lp(%, 200 + e.cutoff * 4000)
  |> out(%, %)
```

This is more compact than calling `bend()` / `aftertouch()` separately for each property.

## Scalar arithmetic

Patterns combine naturally with numbers and signals:

```akk
v"<60 64 67>" + 12          // still a Pattern (Pattern + Number)
v"<0 0.5>" + sig            // Signal (Pattern + Signal coerces)
n"c4 e4 g4" + v"<0 0 12>"   // Pattern + Pattern (combined)
```

## When coerce fails

Polyphonic chord patterns can't silently degrade to one voice:

```akk
osc("sin", c"Am")     // ❌ E160: chord pattern in scalar slot
```

The fix is to consume them with `poly()`, which fans out per voice:

```akk
c"Am C G Em" |> poly(4, fn (e) -> osc("saw", e.freq) * ar(e.trig)) |> out(%, %)
```

Sample patterns route through `SAMPLE_PLAY` and produce audio. Pipe them to `out()` directly:

```akk
s"bd ~ bd ~" |> out(%, %)
```

## scalar(): explicit cast

`scalar(p)` is the explicit form of auto-coerce. Useful for clarity, or for arithmetic outside a DSP slot:

```akk
let detune = scalar(v"<0 -10 10 0>")
osc("saw", n"c4 e4 g4 b4" + detune)
```

`scalar()` errors on sample / polyphonic patterns (E161). It's idempotent on Signals: `scalar(scalar(p))` is safe.
