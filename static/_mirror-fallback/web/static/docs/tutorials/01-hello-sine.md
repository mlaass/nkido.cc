# Your First Sound

Welcome to Akkado! In this tutorial, you'll make your first sound and learn the basics of how the language works.

## The Simplest Patch

Every Akkado program is a signal flow graph. Let's start with the simplest possible patch - a sine wave sent to the output.

```akk
osc("sin", 440) |> out(%, %)
```

Click **Run** above to hear a 440 Hz sine wave (concert A).

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down what each part means:

- `osc("sin", 440)` - Creates a sine wave oscillator at 440 Hz
- `|>` - The **pipe** operator, connecting nodes in the signal flow
- `%` - The **hole**, representing the signal from the left side of the pipe
- `out(%, %)` - Sends the signal to both left and right speakers

## Changing the Frequency

Try different frequencies by changing the number:

```akk
// Lower octave (220 Hz)
osc("sin", 220) |> out(%, %)
```

```akk
// Higher octave (880 Hz)
osc("sin", 880) |> out(%, %)
```

## Adding More Oscillators

You can combine multiple oscillators with math operators:

```akk
// Two detuned oscillators for a fatter sound
osc("sin", 440) + osc("sin", 442) |> out(%, %) * 0.5
```

The `* 0.5` at the end reduces the volume so it doesn't clip.

## Different Waveforms

Akkado has several oscillator types, all accessible through `osc()`:

```akk
// Sawtooth - rich and buzzy
osc("saw", 220) |> out(%, %)
```

```akk
// Triangle - softer than sawtooth
osc("tri", 220) |> out(%, %)
```

```akk
// Square - hollow and punchy
osc("sqr", 220) * 0.3 |> out(%, %)
```

**Tip:** The `osc()` function is the standard way to create all oscillator types. Just change the first argument to select the waveform.

## Next Steps

Now that you can make basic sounds, try:
- Combining different waveforms
- Using math to modulate the frequency
- Moving on to the [Filters tutorial](02-filters.md) to shape your sounds

Congratulations - you've made your first sounds with Akkado!
